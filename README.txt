Instructions:
Run the game by dragging "finalproject.zip" onto love.app (I think this is how it works for macs?) 
The relevant files in "finalproject.zip" for viewing the level generation is "generator", "world", "powerup", "powerupholder", and "level" and "room" to view how the final result works.

Also you might need to have the .DLLs in the folder you run the program in. Once gain, not sure how it works for macs.
